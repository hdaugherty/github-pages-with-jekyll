Welcome to the site
===================


**Hello! I'm Holden**
<p>I'm a Network/Service Technician by trade and aspiring developer in my spare time.
  I'm also a novice maker of electronics, art, music and anything else that me and my 
  daughter can have fun making together. I love to spend time with my fiance and our 
  little girl, read books, watch movies, and be outdoors!</p>
  
  
## About the site
<p> I have built this website for serveral reasons:
  <ul>
    <li>First, I want to learn better developement skills. I am mostly interested in 
      <b>Python Web Developement</b> but am sure to learn some other new things alongs
      the way</li>
    <br>
    <li>Second, I want to put myself out there and meet new people. I hope to also gain 
      better writing, reading, and communication skills. I love to meet new people and 
      speak with them about their journey so feel free to use the Contact section to reach
      me.</li>
     <br>
    <li>Lastly, I will include in the site my resume and job skills, and a portfolio of all the 
      projects I work on throughout the course of my learning. I currently work in IT Support, but
      have joined many communities and training sites, including:
      <ol><li>Talk Python Training</li>
        <li>FreeCodeCamp</li>
        <li>Github Education</li>
        <li>Thinkful</li>
        <li> and Learn.co</li>
      </ol>
      I have also purchased many books on everything from UI/UX design to Python and C Programming 
      languages to aid in my learning. I am starting with some basic understandings  of Python, Ruby, 
      HTML/CSS, and have used a small amount of VCS, but overall I have plenty to learn. I hope that my 
      journey can help someone along the way and make them see that with a little dedication and hardwork 
      anything is possible</li>
